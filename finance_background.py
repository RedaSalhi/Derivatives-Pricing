st.markdown("""
The **Derivatives Pricing App** is built to help users understand and visualize how various financial derivatives are priced and analyzed using different mathematical models. Whether you're a student, a quant, or a curious learner, this app aims to bridge theory and implementation.

st.header("üßÆ Methodology & Pricing Models")
st.markdown("""
We use multiple models depending on the product type:

### 1. **Black-Scholes Model**
- Closed-form analytical model for European options.
- Assumes constant volatility and no early exercise.
- Also extended to price **digital options**.

### 2. **Binomial Tree Model**
- Discrete-time model for both European and American options.
- Useful for early exercise features.
- Supports vanilla, lookback, and barrier options.

### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
- Numerical technique for path-dependent options like Asian or Lookback.
- Simulates thousands of paths under the risk-neutral measure.
- Extended using **Longstaff-Schwartz** for American-style derivatives.

st.header("üìê Greeks & Sensitivities")
st.markdown("""
To help you assess **risk exposure**, the app computes the **Greeks**:
- **Delta** ‚Äì Sensitivity to underlying price.
- **Gamma** ‚Äì Convexity of Delta.
- **Vega** ‚Äì Sensitivity to volatility.
- **Theta** ‚Äì Time decay of the option.
- **Rho** ‚Äì Sensitivity to interest rate changes.

We provide **visual plots** to show how these metrics evolve across strike prices or spot movements.

st.header("üìä Multi-Leg Strategies")
st.markdown("""
In real-world trading, investors often combine multiple options into **strategies**:
- **Spreads**: Vertical, horizontal, diagonal
- **Straddles** and **Strangles**
- **Butterflies** and **Condors**

These strategies can be custom-built and visualized, with **net payoff** and **Greek sensitivity charts**.

st.header("üîß Engineering & Design")
st.markdown("""
- Built in **Python** using **Streamlit** for an interactive frontend.
- Modular pricing logic organized under `/pricing/`:
    - `models/`: Analytical and numerical pricing engines
    - `utils/`: Greek computation and plotting
    - `option_strategies.py`: Strategy builder and payoff engine

You can **extend** this app with new instruments, exotic derivatives, or even real-time data feeds.

st.header("üîç Risk-Neutral Framework")
st.markdown("""
All models assume the **risk-neutral measure**:
> Expected discounted payoff under risk-neutral probability = Current Price

This fundamental idea allows us to price any derivative whose payoff is known and depends on future asset paths.
